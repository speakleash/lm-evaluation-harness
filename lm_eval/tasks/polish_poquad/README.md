# PoQuAD: The Polish Question Answering Dataset
### Website
Title: `PoQuAd -> Polish Question Answering Dataset`

https://clarin.biz/resources/poquad

### Description

A SQuAD-like contribution to building Question Answering tools for Polish. 
It largely follows the usual Machine Reading Comprehension format, but a few innovations are added, 
the key ones being: lower density of annotation, an abstractive answer layer, 
and the inclusion of polar questions.

Additionally, just like in SQuAD 2.0, ‘impossible questions’ are included, 
to ensure that the models can learn to abstain from answering in situations of insufficient information. 
The dataset consists of 70k question-answer pairs with contexts from Polish Wikipedia
